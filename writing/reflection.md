1. Imagine that your organization uses lots of different machine parts which are listed in a giant database for company machinists to use. Before a tool may be used for a job, its availability must be determined. If the tool is available (i.e., the tool is on the shelf), then it can be "checked out" for a use on a task. If not, then the task cannot begin and the employee finds another task for which the tool is available.


Tasks cannot begin until their tools are available for usage. The only way for a company employee to know that the tool is available is by querying it in the database, and if the tool is not available, the task has to wait.

* What solutions can you determine that would automatically search-out changes in the database (i.e., locate any updates to the base) without the technical worker having to write a query? In other words, how might changes to large databases be automatically located and shared with those to rely on the information?

TODO

2. You own a large manufacturing company that uses two giant and disconnected SQL databases to manage information regarding supply, product development, pricing, and similar. The two bases hold lots of common information. You decide that it is necessary to centralize this information on one huge database. 

* What ideas and opinions do you have for designing a database which is to be maintained by other people? How would you document your design to facilitate others in understanding your schema?

TODO

* As you are designing the new centralized database, how would you continue to work with the information former database? How do you keep track of its updates to be able to add to the new database?
